# Pathpoint v2

Pathpoint is a New Relic Open Source app used to model business processes end-to-end. It provides an ideal venue to marry the operational state of an entire process with the key business metrics that evaluate the success of that process - using Pathpoint, your dev and operational teams can draw a straight line from the performance health of the process to the business objectives it services.

## Usage

See [Enabling this App](#enable) for instructions on how to get Pathpoint turned on in your account(s).

Refer to the [Usage Guide](docs/guides/usage/index.md) for full details on using Pathpoint.

And finally, [this article in the New Relic docs website](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/business-observability/intro-pathpoint/) provides additional information about using Pathpoint and best practice for modeling your business journeys in Pathpoint.
